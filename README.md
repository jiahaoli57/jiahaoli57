## About Me

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering at GDUT, advised by [Prof. Yong Zhang](https://glxy.gdut.edu.cn/info/1292/28915.htm). I work on machine learning, online algorithms and combinatorial optimization, and am interested in their applications in the field of quantitative finance. I got my B.A. in Management Science from GDUT in 2020, and am fortunate to have interned at GAC-SOFINCO Auto Finance.

Currently, I am actively seeking a postdoctoral or industry position where I can use machine learning to advance quantitative finance. I expect to graduate with my Ph.D. in June 2025.

Please feel free to contact me if you think our research interests may align.
